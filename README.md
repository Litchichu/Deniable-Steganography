# Deniable-Steganography
Deniable steganography is an effective way to resist coercive attack during secure communication, which the adversary may coerce the communication parties, i.e., the sender or receiver, to disclose the secret message.

This is a pytorch implementation of a receiver-deniable steganographic scheme based on the network structures of HiDDeN: https://github.com/ando-khachatryan/HiDDeN
